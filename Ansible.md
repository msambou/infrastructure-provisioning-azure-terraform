## Ansible

### Install Ansible

    # Update packages
    sudo apt update

    # Install ansible
    sudo apt install ansible -y


### Setting Up the Inventory File
The inventory file contains information about the hosts youâ€™ll manage with Ansible. You can include anywhere from one to several hundred servers in your inventory file, and hosts can be organized into groups and subgroups. 

    sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts

Add the following code sections to the end of the file

    [webservers]
    server1 ansible_host=<server-ip-address-from-terraform>
    server1 ansible_ssh_private_key_file=<path-to-your-key-file>

    [all:vars]
    ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

Whenever you want to check your inventory, you can run:

    ansible-inventory --list -y


### Pinging the Server

    ansible all -m ping -u azureuser
